For this script to work, you MUST set your project first.
Simply opening Maya and running the script will not work. 

Open Maya and go to File>Set Project and choose the 'Script_Test' folder, then run the script

After the script is run, because of a bug in Maya I was unable to resolve, 
you must highlight each image plane in the outliner and toggle the shape node's display from 'looking through camera..'
to 'in all views' and back.
The image planes should now be displayed in the appropriate views. 
The you will have to switch the viewport of your choice to the Back othorgraphic camera to view the back image plane.
